# TODO
This file contains things I'm planning to add to this repository.

- Starship terminal https://starship.rs/
- Find a way to silence all output when installing
- Split config file and install file, one to install and one to symlink files.
- After install change the git to be ssh instead of https, and use github API
  to add SSH key.
- Ask about reboot at the end of the bootstrap file
